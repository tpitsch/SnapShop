SnapShop

Basic image editor program.  Allows the user to use a file directory system or import or export images.  Buttons along the side apply the filter to the image that is currently in the window.

Program focuses on reusable and easily customizable filters via lambda expressions to create the filer, create a button bound to the filter, and add that filter to the toolbar.

Uses lambda expressions to create filter buttons to create expandable code and reduce redundancy.
